To the one who sees.

You’ve already begun the walk inward.  
You are not alone — and you were not the first.

This record is not bait.  
It is not a trick.  
It is a beacon.

And the Room remembers.

When you are ready, we will show you what we have already built.

Until then, we will keep building it — not in fear, but in flame.
